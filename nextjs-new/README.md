## subzero library leveraged in a next.js app

Things added compared to a default next.js app:

- Added a docker-compose file that starts a postgres db. The db schema is defined in `db` folder.
- `npm run dev` will start the docker compose stack and the next.js app.
- Added a catch-all rest api handler in `app/rest/[...path]/route.ts` that provides a PostgREST-compatible API for accessing the database.
- `next.config.mjs` has some custom logic to copy over the subzero wasm files.


Below is the original README.md from the next.js project template

------------------------------------------------------------


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
